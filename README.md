# NAME

Acme::Glue - A placeholder module for code accompanying a Perl photo project

# VERSION

2019.10

# DESCRIPTION

Acme::Glue is the companion Perl module for a Perl photo project, the idea
for the photo project is to have each photo include a small snippet of code.
The code does not have to be Perl, it just has to be something you're quite
fond of for whatever reason

# SNIPPETS

Here are the snippets that accompany the photo project

## LEEJO (transform.pl)

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    #
    # transform an array of hashes into an array of arrays where each array
    # contains the values from the hash sorted by the original hash keys or
    # the passed order of columns (hash slicing)
    my @ordered = $column_order
        ? map { [ @$_{ @{ $column_order } } ] } @{ $chaos }
        : map { [ @$_{sort keys %$_} ] } @{ $chaos };

## LEEJO (hopscotch.p6)

    #!/usr/bin/env perl6

    my @court = (
        [ 'FIN' ],
        [ 9 ,10 ],
        [   8   ],
        [ 6 , 7 ],
        [   5   ],
        [   4   ],
        [ 2 , 3 ],
        [   1   ],
    );

    my $skip = @court.[1..*].pick.pick;
    my @play;

    for @court.reverse -> $hop {
        @play.push( $hop.map( *.subst( /^$skip$/,'ðŸš«' ).list ) );
    }

    say @play.reverse.join( "\n" );
